# TypeScript Challenge - People Cards

## Overview

This project is a **TypeScript challenge** where we define a structured list of people and display their information in a visually appealing format using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to create a well-typed data structure using TypeScript interfaces and present the data dynamically in a web UI.

Each person has an ID, name, age, skills, birthdate, score, status, and an address. The challenge also includes displaying the person's greeting message.

## Features

- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Strict type enforcement using interfaces to ensure the structure of the data.
- **Dynamic HTML Rendering**: The person's details are rendered dynamically into HTML elements.
- **Formatted Birthdate**: The birthdate is formatted to a human-readable format (e.g., `15 May 1998`).
- **Skills List**: Displays the skills of each person in a list format.
- **Greeting**: Displays a greeting message generated by a method in the `Person` object.
- **Responsive UI**: The UI is styled to ensure it looks appealing on different screen sizes.
